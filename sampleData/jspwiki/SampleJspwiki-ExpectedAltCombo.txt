This is a sample for combination alt syntax, as described in UWC-328 

* {color:red}+gooba+{color}
* gah

UWC-356 variant ending for headers
h2. +Test 1+
h2. +Test 2+
The above two lines should transform the same way.

but shouldn't affect non-headers
{color:red}Test 3
testing{color}

what if the decoration is later in the header?
h2. Foo +Bar+
