For the purpose of testing attachment syntax

Getting a file from this page?

A file: [ed.jpeg]

A file with an alias: [alias|ed.jpeg]

How about a non-image file: [ed.txt]
with alias: [alias|ed.txt]

Another page that will reference this attachment: [AttachmentReferringPage]

Inlining? could get from jspwiki.properties, or just guess

[alias|Wiki.png]\\
[hummingbird.jpg]\\
