This is a sample for combination alt syntax, as described in UWC-328 

*%%(text-decoration: underline; color: red) gooba
*gah

UWC-356 variant ending for headers
!! %%(text-decoration: underline)Test 1\\
!! %%(text-decoration: underline)Test 2%%
The above two lines should transform the same way.

but shouldn't affect non-headers
%%(color: red)Test 3\\
testing%%

what if the decoration is later in the header?
!! Foo %%(text-decoration: underline)Bar\\
