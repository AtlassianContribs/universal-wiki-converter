This is a sample page for transforming tag_list widget to contentbylabel

Basic label:
{contentbylabel:labels=test}

What if the label has illegalchars?
{contentbylabel:labels=abcdef}
{contentbylabel:labels=haswhitespace}
(These chars are ok:)
{contentbylabel:labels=abc$%-_+=\"'{~}
right brace and pipe are legal label chars as well, but the former will not be able to be used in a macro, and the latter will have issues with the table converter's line condensing formula. These are, however, unusual chars, so we're not worrying about these for now.

What if there's more than one label?
{contentbylabel:labels=a,b}
{contentbylabel:labels=foo,bar,meh,abc}
