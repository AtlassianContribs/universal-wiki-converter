Sample page for escaping things

Escaping single square brackets:
\[don't do anything]

Normal link (no escape):
[Link|Link]

Backslashes in links (windows shares syntax):
[\\path\to\file.txt]
[alias|\\path\to\file.txt]

Removing backslashes at end of line
Because they're unnecessary.
But leave these ones\\alone.
