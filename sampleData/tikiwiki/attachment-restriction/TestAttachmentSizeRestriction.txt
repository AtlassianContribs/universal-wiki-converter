This attachment should be attached (exists and is an acceptable size):

{img src="img/wiki_up/hummingbird.jpg"}

This attachment should NOT be attached (too big):

{img src="img/wiki_up/testsize.zip"}

This attachment should NOT be attached (doesn't exist) - possible it was ignored by that Wiki Converter's attachment converter, but if an non-existent attachment makes it this far, we want to provide a useful error message:

{img src="img/wiki_up/abc.gif" }
