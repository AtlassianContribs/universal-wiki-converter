This is to test Code blocks bug uwc-97 (maybe this is a list context issue?)

Before
*Listone
**{CODE()}
This is a code block
{CODE}
**Some stuff
**{CODE()}
Another code block!
{CODE}

Another possibility is that this stuff is getting munged by the panel:

^
Starting a panel here

{CODE()}
Non list context code block
{CODE}
Something else
{CODE()}
This is different?
{CODE}

*list context!
**{CODE()}
Something
{CODE}
**still list
**{CODE()}
Something else
{CODE}

About to end the panel
