This is to test Code blocks bug uwc-97 (maybe this is a list context issue?)

Before
* Listone
** {code}
This is a code block
{code}
** Some stuff
** {code}
Another code block!
{code}

Another possibility is that this stuff is getting munged by the panel:

{panel}
Starting a panel here

{code}
Non list context code block
{code}
Something else
{code}
This is different?
{code}

* list context!
** {code}
Something
{code}
** still list
** {code}
Something else
{code}

About to end the panel
{panel}
